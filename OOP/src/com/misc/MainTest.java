/**
 * This class demonstrates the importance of the standard main method signature

 * 
 * <p>
 * In Java, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is responsible for executing
 * programs. The JVM specifically looks for a predefined method signature to
 * locate the entry point of execution.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If we modify the standard main method signature, the JVM will not recognize
 * it as the entry point and will throw an error indicating that the main method
 * is missing.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Standard main method signature:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public static void main(String[] args)
 * </pre>
