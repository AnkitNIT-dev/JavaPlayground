# Java Main Method Signature

This repository demonstrates the importance of using the **standard main method signature** in Java.

## ðŸ“Œ Explanation

In Java, the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is responsible for executing programs. The JVM specifically looks for a predefined method signature to locate the entry point of execution.

### ðŸ”¹ Standard Main Method Signature:
```java
public static void main(String[] args)

If we modify the main method signature, the JVM will not recognize it and will throw an error indicating that the main method is missing.

ðŸ“œ Code Example

/**
 * This class demonstrates the importance of the standard main method signature in Java.
 * 
 * @author Ankit Soni
 */
public class MainTest {

    /**
     * The standard main method that serves as the entry point of the Java program.
     * 
     * @param args Command-line arguments (not used in this example)
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // your code is here
    }
}
ðŸš€ How to Run

javac MainTest.java
java MainTest

ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways

    JVM strictly requires the correct main method signature.
    Modifying the signature leads to runtime errors.
    This repository serves as a quick reference for Java beginners.
